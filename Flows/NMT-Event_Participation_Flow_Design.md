# Nonprofit Membership Tracking - Event Participation Flow Design

## Overview

The Event Participation Flow manages the end-to-end process of registering members for events, tracking their participation, and updating engagement metrics based on attendance. This flow enables nonprofit organizations to efficiently manage event registrations, send automated communications to participants, process event-related payments when applicable, and generate comprehensive participation reports that enhance member engagement tracking.

## Flow Diagram

## Flow Elements

### Input Variables

- **eventId**: ID of the event record
- **memberId**: ID of the member registering for the event (optional, if member is logged in)
- **contactId**: ID of the contact record (for non-member registrations or guests)
- **registrationType**: Type of registration (Member, Non-member, Guest)
- **registrationDate**: Date when registration occurred
- **paymentRequired**: Boolean indicating if payment is required
- **paymentAmount**: Amount to be paid (if applicable)
- **ticketQuantity**: Number of tickets requested
- **attendeeDetails**: List of additional attendee information (for multiple registrations)
- **triggerSource**: Source that triggered the flow (Portal, Staff, API)

### Decision Logic

1. **Registration Type Determination**
   - Different paths for member vs. non-member registrations
   - Special handling for guest registrations through members

2. **Capacity Evaluation**
   - Check if event has reached capacity
   - Waitlist process if needed

3. **Payment Requirement Evaluation**
   - Free event vs. paid event paths
   - Member discount application logic

4. **Confirmation Process**
   - Generate confirmation based on registration type and payment status

### Operations

#### Registration Branch
- Validate member status (if member registration)
- Check event capacity and eligibility requirements
- Create participation record
- Associate with contact/member record
- Add to waitlist if event is at capacity
- Return registration confirmation 

#### Payment Processing Branch (if required)
- Calculate payment amount (applying member discounts if applicable)
- Process payment or generate invoice
- Update participation record with payment status
- Generate receipt

#### Communication Branch
- Send registration confirmation
- Generate calendar invitation
- Schedule reminder communications
- Personalize content based on registration type

#### Post-Event Branch
- Update attendance status
- Calculate engagement points
- Generate attendance certificate (if configured)
- Send thank you/feedback communications

## Implementation Considerations

### Event Configuration Requirements
- Event types and categorization
- Capacity management settings
- Registration window configuration
- Payment requirement settings
- Waitlist functionality

### Member vs. Non-Member Handling
- Different pricing structures
- Member-only events visibility
- Member benefits (early registration, discounts)
- Converting non-member participants to prospects

### Edge Cases
- Handling cancellations and refunds
- Managing waitlist promotions
- Processing group registrations
- Handling recurring events
- Managing multi-session events

## Testing Scenarios

| Scenario | Input | Expected Outcome |
|----------|-------|------------------|
| Standard member registration | Active member, available event | Registration confirmed, engagement score updated |
| Non-member registration | Contact info, available event | Registration confirmed, prospect tag added |
| Registration for full event | Member, event at capacity | Added to waitlist, notification sent |
| Paid event registration | Member, event with fee | Payment processed, receipt generated |
| Cancellation processing | Existing registration | Registration cancelled, refund processed if applicable |
| Group registration | Member, multiple attendees | All attendees registered, single payment processed |
| Waitlist promotion | Member on waitlist, spot becomes available | Registration updated, notification sent |
| Event check-in | Member arrives at event | Attendance recorded, engagement score updated |

## Related Configurations

## Implementation Notes

This document is currently in draft form. The next steps for this design include:

1. Complete flow diagram with detailed branching logic
2. Define specific engagement score calculations
3. Develop detailed registration form requirements
4. Create test scenarios for various event types
5. Review integration requirements with existing calendar and communication systems

**Note**: This flow design provides a foundation for event participation tracking and should be expanded based on the specific event management requirements of the nonprofit organization. The implementation should be coordinated with the Membership Onboarding Flow to ensure consistent engagement tracking.
