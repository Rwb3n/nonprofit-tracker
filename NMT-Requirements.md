# Nonprofit Membership Tracking - Requirements Document

## Business Context

Nonprofit organizations rely heavily on memberships as a source of sustainable funding and community building. Managing these memberships efficiently is critical to organizational success but can become administratively burdensome without proper systems in place. Many nonprofits struggle with:

- Tracking membership statuses and renewal dates
- Managing different membership levels and benefits
- Processing renewals efficiently
- Measuring member engagement
- Generating meaningful reports for leadership
- Supporting both individual and organizational memberships

This project aims to solve these challenges by creating a customized membership tracking system within Salesforce NPSP, leveraging the platform's flexibility and automation capabilities.

## User Profiles

The system will support three primary user profiles:

1. **Membership Coordinator**
   - Primary day-to-day user
   - Responsible for member communication and renewals
   - Needs efficient processes for onboarding and renewals
   - Requires visibility into upcoming renewals and member status

2. **Development/Fundraising Staff**
   - Focuses on member cultivation and upgrades
   - Needs insights into member engagement patterns
   - Requires data to identify upgrade opportunities
   - Tracks membership fundraising metrics

3. **Executive Leadership**
   - Requires high-level membership health metrics
   - Focuses on financial implications and growth trends
   - Needs data for strategic planning and board reporting
   - Less frequent system user, primarily views reports
