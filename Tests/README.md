# Nonprofit Membership Tracking - Tests Directory

## Purpose

This directory contains all test case documentation for the Nonprofit Membership Tracking project. The test documentation defines validation scenarios for the system's functionality, focusing on flows, data integrity, and user interactions.

## Document Index

- **[NMT-Membership_Onboarding_Flow_Test_Cases.md](NMT-Membership_Onboarding_Flow_Test_Cases.md)**: Comprehensive test cases for the membership onboarding flow, including individual and organizational registration paths, payment processing, and error handling scenarios.

- **[NMT-Membership_Renewal_Flow_Test_Cases.md](NMT-Membership_Renewal_Flow_Test_Cases.md)**: Test cases for validating the membership renewal process, including notification handling, payment processing, and status updates.

- **[NMT-Payment_Status_Handling_Flow_Test_Cases.md](NMT-Payment_Status_Handling_Flow_Test_Cases.md)**: Test cases for validating the payment status handling flow, including successful and failed payments, partial payments, refunds, and edge cases such as duplicate payments and installment plans.

- **[NMT-Event_Participation_Flow_Test_Cases.md](NMT-Event_Participation_Flow_Test_Cases.md)**: Test cases for validating the event participation flow, including registration, payment processing, waitlist management, cancellations, check-ins, and post-event engagement tracking.

## Test Case Organization

Each test case document follows a consistent structure:

1. **Overview**: Introduction to the test scope and objectives
2. **Test Environment**: Details about sandbox, versions, and test users
3. **Test Case Definitions**: Individual test cases with:
   - ID and description
   - Test data
   - Prerequisites
   - Steps
   - Expected results
   - Actual results
   - Status

## Document Usage

The test documentation is primarily used by:

- **Quality Assurance Teams**: For validation of implemented features
- **Developers**: For understanding test requirements during implementation
- **System Administrators**: For user acceptance testing
- **Project Managers**: For tracking test coverage and success metrics

## Document Standards

All test documentation in this directory follows these standards:

1. **Standardized Frontmatter**: Consistent metadata format for all test documents
2. **Test Case IDs**: Format TC-{FlowAbbreviation}-### (e.g., TC-PSH-001)
3. **Comprehensive Test Data**: Full JSON or formatted data examples
4. **Clearly Defined Expected Results**: Specific validation criteria
5. **Documented Actual Results**: Space for recording test outcomes
6. **Status Indicators**: Visual markers for test status (PASSED, FAILED, NOT TESTED)
