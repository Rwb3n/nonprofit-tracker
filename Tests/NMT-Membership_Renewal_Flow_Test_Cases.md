- **Test Date**: [Date]
- **Tester**: [Name]
- **Environment**: [Sandbox Name]
- **Status**: [Pass/Fail/Blocked/Deferred]
- **Actual Results**: [Description]
- **Defects**: [List of defect IDs if any]
- **Screenshots/Evidence**: [Attachments if any]
- **Notes**: [Additional observations]

### Defect Tracking

Defects will be tracked with the following severity levels:

- **Critical**: System crash, data corruption, security breach
- **High**: Major functionality broken, no workaround
- **Medium**: Functionality issue with workaround
- **Low**: Minor issue, cosmetic, documentation error

Each defect should include:
- Severity
- Description
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs. actual behavior
- Screenshots/evidence
- Affected test cases

## Acceptance Criteria

The Membership Renewal Flow will be considered ready for production when:

1. All Critical and High defects are resolved
2. 90% of test cases pass
3. Performance tests show acceptable response times
4. Security review shows no vulnerabilities
5. User acceptance testing is complete with stakeholder approval
