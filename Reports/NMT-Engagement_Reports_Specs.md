# Engagement Reports Specifications

## Overview

This document outlines the specifications for engagement reports within the Nonprofit Membership Tracking system. These reports provide insights into how members interact with the organization, helping to identify highly engaged members, at-risk members, and opportunities to increase overall engagement. The engagement metrics and reports are designed to enable data-driven strategies for member retention and growth.

## Report Audiences

The engagement reports are designed for the following primary audience groups:

1. **Membership Team**
   - Focus: Member activity tracking, engagement intervention, and relationship management
   - Frequency of Use: Daily/Weekly
   - Key Requirements: Actionable insights, individual member views, communication triggers

2. **Program Team**
   - Focus: Event and program effectiveness, participation patterns, content relevance
   - Frequency of Use: Monthly
   - Key Requirements: Program-level analytics, demographic insights

3. **Executive Leadership**
   - Focus: Strategic engagement trends, member satisfaction, and retention risk
   - Frequency of Use: Quarterly
   - Key Requirements: High-level trend visualization, segmentation analysis

## Engagement Scoring Model

The foundation of all engagement reports is the Engagement Scoring Model:

**Base Components**:
- **Event Participation**: Weighted by event type and recency
- **Communication Response**: Email opens, clicks, form submissions
- **Volunteer Activity**: Hours contributed, leadership roles
- **Online Interaction**: Portal logins, resource downloads, forum activity
- **Membership Tenure**: Length of continuous membership
- **Financial Support**: Additional donations beyond membership dues

**Score Calculation**:
- Each component contributes to a 100-point scale
- Component weights are configurable by organization
- Decay factors reduce impact of older activities
- Rolling 12-month window for most metrics

**Engagement Levels**:
- 75-100: Highly Engaged (Champions)
- 50-74: Engaged (Core Members)
- 25-49: Moderately Engaged (Occasional Participants)
- 0-24: Disengaged (At Risk)
