## Before moving forward with the refactoring:
### discussing ideas of versioning:
- flow naming convention ==`(prefix)_(business process)_(function)_v_(version)`
- version lock when it's reference by others by adding a ==`_locked`== suffix
	- Example scenario:
	- create a flow: ==`Lead_Qualification_Score_Flow`==
	- another flow: ==`Opportunity_Creation_Flow`== needs to reference it
	- before establishing the reference, duplicate ==`Lead_Qualification_Score_Flow`== to:
		-  ==`Lead_Qualification_Score_Flow_v_1_0_0_locked`
	- ==`Opportunity_Creation_Flow`== calls the locked version above
	- Can continue to improve original ==`Lead_Qualification_Score_Flow`==
- when ready to update, test the latest version, add locked prefix, update references, and clone a new working version.

- Trade off is increased governance complexity, but allows explicit version control without the need for apex.
## Layered Architecture:

#### Instead of purely flow centric approach, think of this:
- **UI LAYER:** (INTERFACE)
	- user interaction, data entry, real time feedback updates
	- only screen flows and guide processes
- **SERVICE LAYER:** (CORE)
	- transaction integrity
	- error handling & data consistency
- **BATCH LAYER:** (INTEGRATION VAI PLATFORM EVENTS)
	- bulk recalcs, i.e: YTD metrics & waitlist promotions
	- operatives async to minimize impact

## Compensating mechanism:

- for example:
	- Flow A: event registration
	- Flow B: metric update

- If flow A succeeds and flow B fails, results in inconsistent data. 
- Need a mechanism for blocking, reversing, or mitigating failed operations.
- Apex try-catch mechanism

### Create a thin ==`Validation`== layer between ==`UI`== & ==`Service`== Layers

## Proposed Next Steps (carried out in [[7. Architecture Audit]] ):
- ERD for event participation audit
- transaction boundaries
	- apex vs flow boundaries:
