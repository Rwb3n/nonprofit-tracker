# Why: separation of concerns, trigger contexts, bloat.
### **The New Plan: Modular Flow Design**

We’re going to **restart our journey** by doing it **right from the start**.

1. **Map Out Responsibilities:** What does each flow actually need to do?
2. **Break Down the Big Flow:** Identify which parts should be split into separate flows.
3. **Design Flow Structure:** Build each flow as an **independent unit** that can be maintained separately.
4. **Document the Purpose:** Clearly define what each flow is responsible for.

### **Step 1: High-Level Flow Breakdown**

Here’s the clean modular breakdown I propose:

#### **1. Event Registration Flow (Screen Flow):**

- **Purpose:** Handle the user interaction for event sign-ups.
    
- **Triggers:** Manual/User-triggered
    
- **Responsibilities:**
    
    - Get registration details
    - Validate member or guest
    - Check capacity
    - Calculate payment
    - Create the **Member Event Participation** record
    - Send confirmation

- **Output:** Creates a **Participation Record**

---

#### **2. Contact Event Metrics Update Flow (Record-Triggered Flow):**

- **Purpose:** Automatically update contact metrics after a new participation record is created or updated.
    
- **Triggers:** After Save (Record-Triggered)
    
- **Responsibilities:**
    
    - Check attendance status
    - Get related **Contact**
    - Get event date
    - Update **Last Event Attended**
    - Update **Events Attended (YTD)**

- **Output:** Updated **Contact** record


---

#### **3. Post-Event Engagement Update Flow (Scheduled Flow):**

- **Purpose:** Update **engagement scores** and handle **yearly resets**.
    
- **Triggers:** Scheduled (e.g., once a year)
    
- **Responsibilities:**
    - Reset YTD event count
    - Recalculate engagement scores
- **Output:** Clean slate for the new year
    

---

#### **4. Payment and Invoice Processing Flow (Auto-Triggered Flow):**

- **Purpose:** Handle payments for events.
    
- **Triggers:** When a payment is submitted
    
- **Responsibilities:**
    
    - Validate payment details
    - Process transaction
    - Update **Payment Status**
- **Output:** Payment processed and recorded
    

---

#### **5. Waitlist Management Flow (Auto-Triggered Flow):**

- **Purpose:** Handle the logic for adding/removing members from the waitlist.
    
- **Triggers:** After Event Capacity Changes
    
- **Responsibilities:**
    
    - Add to waitlist if full
    - Promote from waitlist if capacity opens
- **Output:** Updated **Waitlist Record**
