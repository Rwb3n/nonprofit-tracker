- removed **membership event participation** (MEP) object's lookup to **contact** : not required.
- why?
	- already has 2 lookups: membership_c & event_c
	- membership_c already connected to contact or account
		- a MEP record can access a contact record via **MEP.membership.contact**
	- however a membership can be linked to **account** instead of **contact**
		- in this scenario the **MEP.membership.contact** path would be null
- considering modular flows:
- member registration:
	- **MEP** record created. it's linked to **membership** record. **contact** could be derived from membership in this scenarion
- non-member registration:
	- [[4. Modular Flow Redev]] suggests: create/update a contact record and then create the **MEP** record
		- how could this MEP be lived to the contact record.... if there's no **membership** record...!
		- the current model REQUIRES a membership lookup. seems like a conflict.
- guest registration:
	- similar to non-members, how would the guest's registration be tracked if they dont have their own membership record.
	- organizational memberships.
		- if an account holds the membership. multiple contacts under that account might attend an event.
		- linking the **MEP** to the **membership** linked to the **account** DOESNT identify the specific **contact** that is attending.
			- in this canse **MEP**.contact *is necessary*.

### Findings:

- **conflicts:** **MEP** requiring **membership** lookup conflicts with need to track non-member & specific contacts under org memberships
- **redundancy:** for *individual memberships*: MEP.contact field is **redundant** because the participant is always the contact linked to the membership record.
- **necessity:** for *org memberships*: the MEP.contact field is **necessary** to identify the atendee.
- **GAP:** the model doesnt cleanly suppoer the tracking for non-members because the membership lookup  is required.

### Proposal:

- modify the **MEP** object:
	- **membership** lookup **NOT REQUIRED** (DONE)
	- **contact** lookup **REQUIRED** (DONE)
	- add **account** lookup **NOT REQUIRED** (DONE)

	- MEP logic: now MEP records - participants - must be represented by a contact record - this is the primary link for participation

	- IF PARTICIPANT attending VIA active **membership**: populate the **membership lookup**
		- for individual memberships > **MEP.contact**  match with **MEP.membership.contact**. 
			- validation rule can enforce this.
		- for org memberships > **MEP.contact** identifies the specific attendee. while **MEP.membership** links to the **org** membership record > which in turn links to the **account**)
	- for NON-MEMBER > create contact record (if doesn't exist). link this newly created record via the **required lookup** (look at the earlier modification note)

	- if tracking participation at org level, can use the optional **account** lookup. but think carefully and consider if linking via the contact's primary account OR affiliation might be preferred.

#### benefits:
- single source of truth: **CONTACT** is now the source of truth.
- supports all cases: individual member, org member, non-member
- remove conflict
- clarify relationships.
