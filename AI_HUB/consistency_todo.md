# Nonprofit Membership Tracking - Consistency Implementation Todo List

This document outlines the specific tasks required to improve documentation consistency across the Nonprofit Membership Tracking project. It serves as an actionable plan based on the consistency analysis performed across all project documentation.

## Phase 1: Documentation Consolidation (2 days)

### Day 1: Index and Core Document Consolidation

#### Index Documents
- [x] Merge valuable content from INDEX.MD into README.md
- [x] Update all file references in README.md to ensure accuracy
- [x] Add deprecation notice to INDEX.MD

#### Data Model Documentation
- [x] Merge `NMT-Data_Structure.md` and `NMT-Data_Model_Design.md` into consolidated `NMT-Data_Model_Design_Consolidated.md`
- [x] Include implementation notes and triggers from `NMT-Data_Structure.md`
- [x] Keep validation rules and field requirements from `NMT-Data_Model_Design.md`
- [x] Resolve any conflicting field definitions or inconsistent ERDs
- [x] Add deprecation notice to `NMT-Data_Structure.md`
- [x] Update references to data model documentation in all other documents

#### Dashboard Documentation
- [x] Decide on home for dashboard documentation (recommendation: Reports directory)
- [x] Consolidate `Docs/NMT-Dashboard_Component_Specs.md` and `Reports/NMT-Dashboard_Design.md`
- [x] Create final `Reports/NMT-Dashboard_Design.md` with comprehensive content
- [x] Add deprecation notice to `Docs/NMT-Dashboard_Component_Specs.md`
- [x] Update all references to dashboard documentation

#### Flow Documentation
- [ ] Consolidate `NMT-Membership_Onboarding_Flow.md` and `NMT-Membership_Onboarding_Flow_Design.md`
- [ ] Keep the more detailed version and incorporate any unique content
- [x] Add deprecation notice to `Flows/NMT-Membership_Onboarding_Flow.md`
- [ ] Ensure consistent flow diagrams and implementation details

### Day 2: Rename and Reorganize

#### File Renaming
- [x] Rename `Tests/NMT-Flow_Test_Cases.md` to `Tests/NMT-Membership_Onboarding_Flow_Test_Cases.md`
- [x] Add deprecation/renaming notice to `Tests/NMT-Flow_Test_Cases.md`
- [x] Update all references to renamed files in index and cross-references

#### Directory Organization
- [x] Create README.md files in each directory explaining its purpose:
  - [x] Docs: Technical specifications and design documents
  - [x] Flows: Flow design specifications 
  - [x] Tests: Test cases and validation procedures
  - [x] Reports: Dashboard and report specifications

#### Missing Documentation Creation
- [x] Create `Flows/NMT-Membership_Renewal_Flow_Design.md` to match existing test cases
- [x] Draft outlines for other mentioned flows:
  - [x] Payment Status Handling Flow
  - [x] Event Participation Flow

## Next Steps for Document Consolidation

1. **Complete Data Model Documentation Consolidation**:
   - [x] Compare both documents to identify unique content in each
   - [x] Create a consolidated outline that preserves all valuable information
   - [x] Ensure field definitions are consistent between documents
   - [x] Preserve the ERD from NMT-Data_Structure.md
   - [x] Incorporate implementation notes and triggers information

2. **Complete Dashboard Documentation Consolidation**:
   - [x] Move comprehensive content to Reports directory
   - [x] Ensure dashboard component specifications are preserved
   - [x] Update any references to dashboard documentation in other files

3. **Complete Flow Documentation Consolidation**:
   - [ ] Compare both flow documents for unique content
   - [ ] Ensure flow diagrams are consistent and accurate
   - [ ] Preserve all detailed implementation specifications

4. **Create Test Case Documents for New Flows**:
   - [x] Create test cases for Payment Status Handling Flow
   - [x] Create test cases for Event Participation Flow

## Phase 2: Content Standardization (2 days)

### Day 3: Metadata and Structure Standardization

#### Frontmatter Standardization
- [x] Define consistent frontmatter format for all documents:
  ```yaml
  ---
  title: "Document Title"
  project: "Nonprofit Membership Tracking"
  type: "[Documentation|Flow|Report|Test]"
  phase: "[Planning|Design|Build|Testing|Implementation]"
  status: "[Draft|In Progress|Completed]"
  version: "1.0"
  created: "YYYY-MM-DD"
  updated: "YYYY-MM-DD"
  author: "Project Team"
  ---
  ```
- [x] Use lowercase field names consistently (`title:` not `Title:`)
- [x] Update all dates to YYYY-MM-DD format

#### Document Structure Standardization
- [x] Ensure each document has:
  - [x] Consistent H1 (title) at the beginning
  - [x] Overview section after title
  - [x] Consistent heading levels for similar content
- [x] Apply uniform formatting for tables, code blocks, and diagrams
- [x] Standardize field definition tables (columns, order, formatting)

#### Test Case Standardization
- [x] Choose a standard test case ID format (recommendation: TC-{Category}-###)
- [x] Apply consistent test case structure to all test documents
- [x] Standardize test categorization approach
- [x] Align test case status reporting (pass/fail indicators)

### Day 4: Content Gap Filling and Cross-Referencing

#### Implementation Backlog Alignment
- [x] Update Progress.md with documentation consistency implementation tasks
- [x] Add missing tasks:
  - [x] Payment Status Handling Flow
  - [x] Event Participation tracking process
  - [ ] Email templates
  - [ ] Permission sets and profiles
  - [ ] Payment processor integration
  - [ ] Data import/export utilities
- [x] Add explicit testing tasks
- [x] Add specific report development tasks

#### Cross-References
- [x] Add links between related documents:
  - [x] Flow designs → test cases
  - [x] Data model → flows that use it
  - [x] Reports → dashboards that display them
- [x] Add consistency documentation references to README.md

#### Timeline Consistency
- [x] Reconcile timeline information between:
  - [x] Project Plan
  - [x] Implementation Plan
  - [x] Progress tracker
- [x] Update dates and milestones to ensure consistency

## Phase 3: Final Review and Templates (1 day)

### Day 5: Comprehensive Review and Standardization

#### Final Consistency Check
- [ ] Verify all files follow established standards
- [ ] Check all links and references
- [ ] Update timestamps and version numbers
- [ ] Proofread all consolidated documents

#### Documentation Templates
- [x] Create standardized templates for future documentation:
  - [x] Data Model Documentation Template
  - [x] Flow Design Template
  - [x] Test Case Template
  - [x] Report/Dashboard Template
  - [x] Template usage guidelines in README

#### Documentation Style Guide
- [x] Define guidelines for frontmatter standards (defined in this document)
- [x] Define file naming conventions (defined in this document)
- [ ] Create complete documentation style guide document with:
  - [ ] Writing style guidelines (tone, voice, terminology)
  - [ ] Formatting examples
  - [ ] Template usage instructions

## Long-term Consistency Management

### Version Control Practices
- [x] Establish guidelines for documenting changes (version numbering in frontmatter)
- [ ] Add change log sections to all documents
- [x] Develop version numbering system (implemented in Project Plan and Progress tracker)

### Regular Documentation Audits
- [x] Schedule quarterly documentation reviews (defined in Project Plan)
- [x] Assign ownership for maintaining documentation standards (assigned to Documentation Team)
- [x] Create checklist for documentation quality control (this document serves as the checklist)

## Priority Tasks

If time is limited, focus on these high-impact tasks:

1. [x] Data model documentation consolidation
2. [x] Dashboard documentation consolidation
3. [x] Create remaining flow documentation
4. [x] Standardize document structures
5. [x] Create document templates

## Dependencies

- Data model consolidation should be completed before updating Progress.md

- Documentation templates should be created after standardizing existing documents

## Completion Criteria

This consistency implementation will be considered complete when:

1. All duplicate documentation is consolidated
2. All files follow the naming convention
3. All metadata is in the standardized format
4. All cross-references are accurate
