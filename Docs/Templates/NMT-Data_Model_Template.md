## Object Configuration Considerations

### Allow Reports Considerations

When deciding whether to enable **Allow Reports** for an object, consider:

- **Enable (Yes)** when:
  - End users need to perform analysis on this object's data
  - The object data is relevant for executive or operational dashboards
  - Data needs to be accessible via the Salesforce report builder
  - The object will be the basis for list views or exports

- **Disable (No)** when:
  - The object contains sensitive data that should not be broadly reportable
  - The object is only used for technical implementation and not business reporting
  - The object contains transitory data not meant for long-term analysis
  - System performance is a concern (limiting reportable objects can improve performance)

### Allow Activities Considerations

When deciding whether to enable **Allow Activities** for an object, consider:

- **Enable (Yes)** when:
  - Users need to log calls, emails, or tasks related to records of this object
  - The object represents an entity that has direct communication with users (like members, organizations)
  - The object is part of a workflow that requires task assignment
  - Historical activity tracking is important for this object

- **Disable (No)** when:
  - The object is used for configuration or technical purposes only
  - Activities would be more logically associated with a parent object
  - System simplicity is a priority and activities can be tracked elsewhere
  - The object represents a transaction or event where activities don't make logical sense

### Track Field History Considerations

When deciding whether to enable **Track Field History** for an object, consider:

- **Enable (Yes)** when:
  - The object contains fields that change frequently and change history is important
  - Compliance or audit requirements necessitate tracking changes
  - There are fields with high business value where tracking modifications is critical
  - Governance processes require visibility into who changed what and when

- **Disable (No)** when:
  - The object has high data volume and enabling history tracking would create performance issues
  - Changes to the object are not meaningful for business or compliance purposes
  - The data is static or rarely changes
  - Tracking is handled externally or via another mechanism

**Note:** When enabling Track Field History, you are limited to tracking 20 fields per object. Prioritize:
- Fields with compliance or regulatory importance
- Fields that drive key business processes
- Fields that are frequently disputed or questioned
- Fields with financial or legal implications
