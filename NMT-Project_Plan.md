# Nonprofit Membership Tracking - Project Plan

## Executive Summary

This project aims to design and build a custom membership tracking system for nonprofit organizations using Salesforce NPSP (Nonprofit Success Pack). The system will enable nonprofits to efficiently manage their membership programs, automate routine tasks, and gain valuable insights through reporting and analytics.

As a Salesforce Administrator project, this implementation demonstrates proficiency in:
- Custom object modeling and relationships
- Process automation through Flow
- Report and dashboard design
- Testing and quality assurance

## Project Scope

### In Scope
- Development in a Salesforce Developer Edition org with NPSP
- Custom data model for membership tracking
- Automation for member onboarding and renewal processes
- Reports and dashboards for membership insights
- Testing documentation and validation

### Out of Scope
- Production deployment
- Integration with external payment systems
- Custom Apex development
- Community portal for member self-service

## Approach

The project will follow a four-phase approach:

1. **Setup Phase**
   - Spin up Developer Edition org
   - Install and configure NPSP
   - Document environment configuration

2. **Design Phase**
   - Define data model (objects, fields, relationships)
   - Create entity-relationship diagrams
   - Map processes for automation
   - Design report and dashboard requirements

3. **Build Phase**
   - Create custom objects and fields
   - Configure page layouts and record types
   - Develop Flow automations
   - Build reports and dashboards

4. **Testing Phase**
   - Create test cases
   - Perform user acceptance testing
   - Document test results
   - Finalize documentation

## Timeline

| Phase | Start Date | End Date | Duration | Key Deliverables |
|-------|------------|----------|----------|------------------|
| Setup | 2025-03-25 | 2025-03-26 | 2 days | ✓ Configured Developer Org<br>✓ NPSP Installation |
| Design | 2025-03-26 | 2025-03-28 | 3 days | ✓ Data Model Documentation<br>✓ Process Flow Diagrams |
| Build | 2025-03-28 | 2025-04-03 | 7 days | ✓ Custom Objects<br>✓ Flow Automation<br>✓ Reports/Dashboards |
| Testing | 2025-04-03 | 2025-04-05 | 3 days | ✓ Test Cases<br>✓ Test Results<br>✓ Final Documentation |

## Key Deliverables

### Documentation
- Data model specification
- Flow design documents
- Test cases and results
- Dashboard specifications

### Salesforce Configuration
- Custom objects and fields
- Configured page layouts
- Record types and field-level security
- Flows for process automation
- Reports and dashboards

## Resource Requirements

### Technical Resources
- Salesforce Developer Edition org
- NPSP (Nonprofit Success Pack)
- Schema Builder for data modeling
- Flow Builder for automation
- Report Builder for analytics

### Knowledge Resources
- Salesforce Admin certification knowledge
- NPSP documentation
- Trailhead modules on Flow, Reports, and Custom Objects
- Salesforce best practices

## Success Criteria

This project will be considered successful when:

1. All custom objects and fields are properly configured
2. Member onboarding flow executes successfully through all test cases
3. Reports and dashboards provide accurate membership insights
4. All documentation is complete and accurate

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| NPSP installation complexity | Medium | Medium | Review installation guide and Trailhead modules before starting |
| Flow logic complexity | High | Medium | Break flows into smaller, manageable components |
| Testing coverage gaps | Medium | Low | Create comprehensive test cases in advance |
| Report limitations | Low | Low | Understand Salesforce reporting capabilities and limitations |

## Governance

### Documentation Standards
- All documents will include standard frontmatter with title, status, and date
- Field and object naming will follow Salesforce best practices
- Diagrams will be included for complex relationships and processes

### Testing Approach
- Define test cases before building
- Test each component individually
- Perform end-to-end testing of complete processes
- Document all test results

## Implementation Strategy

### Data Model Implementation
1. Create custom objects in planned sequence
2. Configure fields with appropriate data types and validation
3. Establish relationships between objects
4. Configure page layouts and compact layouts

### Flow Development
1. Map process requirements and decision points
2. Develop screen flows first for visibility and testing
3. Add complex logic and record operations
4. Test with varied scenarios and edge cases

### Report and Dashboard Creation
1. Create base reports for each analytical need
2. Group reports in functional folders
3. Build dashboards leveraging created reports
4. Configure dashboard refresh settings and subscriptions

## Final Deliverables Checklist

- [ ] Fully configured Developer org
- [ ] Comprehensive data model documentation
- [ ] Functional membership onboarding flow
- [ ] Test case documentation with results
- [ ] Executive, operational, and engagement dashboards
- [ ] Complete project documentation

## Next Steps

1. Provision Developer org and install NPSP
2. Familiarize with NPSP data model and customization options
3. Begin detailed data model design
4. Set up project documentation structure
