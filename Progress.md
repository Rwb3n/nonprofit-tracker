## Notes & Issues

**2025-04-02**:
- Have to review the following custom fields in Account:
	- Last Event Attended 
	- Events Attended (YTD)

- Boolean formulas in standard objects can't use picklists. had to find solution:
	- [[NMT-Data_Model_Design_Consolidated#Is Member (Contact)]]
		- instead of =, use ISPICKVAL
	- [[NMT-Data_Model_Design_Consolidated#Membership Status (Contact)]]
		- similar as above, but if i want text rather than true/false, then I want to use TEXT
- Some formulas which might've been seen as obvious weren't documented.
	- i.e Contact custom field 'Membership Since': ``npt_Current_Membership__r.Member_Since__c``
	- 'Member Contacts' Rollup Summary needs solving.

**2025-04-02**:
- Documentation team has completed design and documentation tasks
- Build & Configuration tasks are handled by the development team and are in progress
- Documentation standardization activities planned for April to ensure consistency across all project documents
- Resource allocation for Sprint 4 needs confirmation
- Pending decision on additional reporting requirements from Finance department
- Integration testing with payment processor delayed due to API access issues
