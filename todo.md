## Notes
- Documentation should follow the standards in the AI_USER_GUIDE_FOR_PROJECT_WORKSPACES.md file
- All documents should include standardized frontmatter
- References between documents should use relative links
- The CHANGELOG.md file should be updated at the end of each work session with all changes made 
- All new documents should be created using the templates in the Docs/Templates directory
- Once work begins on a todo item, no additional scope may be added to that task
